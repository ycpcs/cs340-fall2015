Your Task
=========

Start with the following source file:

> [tictactoe.scala](tictactoe.scala)

You can run the program with the command

    scala tictactoe.scala

See if you can extend the program so that it allows the user to enter moves (alternating between X and O). The program should check for a winner after each move. If you can, check to make sure that each move entered is legal.
